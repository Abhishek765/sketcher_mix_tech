# sketcher_mix_tech(An application that can make your photos into pencil sketches ✏)
Project made using Android(Front-end) + Python(backend)
This is Awesome!!!
# what this project is all about?(Mix-Tech)
  With this project I am trying whether can we connect Android as front-end and python as backend so that we can use python cool Machine learning models/algorithms in our        android too!!! (Yes we have firebase for Android but I want to try this😎😎!!!)

**Android Part** - Basically in android part we can select images from our phone storage and send it to our server for processing.
**Python part** - Using python framework **FLASK** created an API that handles the request coming from android, process it and send back the result to Front-end🔥.

# Fork the project and enjoy👍!!!
